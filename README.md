# Foundry 1.20.1

**Foundry** is an Industrial modpack for Forge 1.20.1 designed from the ground up.
## Pack Goals

* **Scripting:** Roughly 2,000 lines of custom code and scripts written for the pack.
* **Overhauled Progression:** Hundreds of recipe changed adding integration between all mods.
* **Performance Optimized:** Specifically adjusted for stability and fast load times no matter what hardware.
  
**Launcher:** [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) is **required** for the **best** experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Development has migrated away from CurseForge.** Due to redundant asset checks, CurseForge load times are significantly longer.
